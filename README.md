## Gym Exercise Tracker App

Hi there,

Thank you for visiting this gym app that I have created. I wanted to create this app to save my gym workouts and to track my progress, instead of using an excel worksheet.

The app allows you to add a variety of exercises, which you can search from different categories and add in different exercises in various folders. 

## To start:

1. Create a folder.
2. Inside the folder create a new page.
3. In the page you can search for any gym workout of your choosing.
4. In the workout, choose the amount of sets and enter in your weights and reps.
5. Based on the number of sets you create, swipe right on the weights and reps to add in more weights/reps.

This is the first version of this web app. It was created using ReactJS for the frontend and MongoDB and NodeJs in the backend.

I am currently working on version 2 where there will be authentication, you will be able to track your previous workouts, start a workout with a timer and will contain more apps all in this one dashboard.

The stack I am using for V2 is NextJS, Typescript and NodeJS. So keep a lookout for that!


## Here is a small app preview: 

Inside the pages you can search for any exercise you are after:

You can add in your exercises and add in your sets, reps and weights. 

The reps and weights are dependant on the sets. So if you have 3 sets, you can add in 3 reps and weight amounts.

This app is completely mobile responsive.
